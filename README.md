A highly customizable tool to track Minecraft progress beyond just Advancements. <br>
This tracker also supports modded advancements and statistics. <br>

### How can it be used?

Besides the default categories you can create your own .json template and language file based on the minecraft version and speedrunning category and it will then track whatever you tell it to in the template file.
Advancely allows you to track advancements, recipes, statistics (can also be checked off manually), unlocks (25w14craftmine snapshot), manual goals (you can check off) and multi stage goals (tracking advancements, recipes and statistics with target goals).
