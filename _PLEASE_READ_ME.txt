==================================================
IMPORTANT: How to Run Advancely Correctly
==================================================

Thank you for using Advancely! To ensure the application works correctly, please follow the instructions for your operating system.

--------------------------------------------------
--- For Windows, macOS, & Linux Users ---
--------------------------------------------------

Your application folder contains the main executable (`Advancely.exe`, `Advancely`, etc.), required library files, and the `resources` folder.

✔️ **CORRECT WAY:**
To run Advancely from another location (like your Desktop or Dock), please create a shortcut.
- **Windows:** Right-click `Advancely.exe` -> "Create shortcut".
- **macOS:** Right-click `Advancely` -> "Make Alias".
- **Linux:** Right-click `Advancely` -> "Create Link".

You can move this new shortcut, alias, or link anywhere you like.

❌ **INCORRECT WAY:**
DO NOT move or copy the original executable file by itself. It will not be able to find its resources or libraries and will fail to start, run, or save correctly. The executable must always stay in the same folder as its supporting files.

==================================================
TL;DR (Summary)
==================================================

- On all systems, don't move the executable out of its folder. Create a shortcut/alias/link to it instead.
