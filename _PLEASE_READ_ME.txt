==================================================
IMPORTANT: How to Run Advancely Correctly
==================================================

Thank you for using Advancely! To ensure the application works correctly, please follow the instructions for your operating system.

--------------------------------------------------
--- For Windows & Linux Users ---
--------------------------------------------------

Your application folder contains the main executable (`Advancely.exe` or `Advancely`) and the required `resources` folder.

✔️ **CORRECT WAY:**
To run Advancely from another location (like your Desktop), please create a shortcut or a symbolic link to the executable.

❌ **INCORRECT WAY:**
DO NOT move or copy the original executable file out of its folder. It will not be able to find the `resources` folder and will fail to start or save settings correctly.

--------------------------------------------------
--- For macOS Users ---
--------------------------------------------------

Your application is a self-contained `Advancely.app` bundle. All required files are located inside it.

✔️ **CORRECT WAY:**
You can move the `Advancely.app` file anywhere you like, such as your Desktop or the Applications folder. To create a quick-launch link, simply drag the `Advancely.app` icon to your Dock.

==================================================
TL;DR (Summary)
==================================================

- **Windows/Linux:** Don't move the executable out of its folder. Create a shortcut instead.
- **macOS:** You can move the `Advancely.app` file anywhere you want.
